## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-29

First public release. A Bevy 0.18 plugin that renders Noesis XAML interfaces into
your frame: it runs Noesis on Bevy's GPU, composites the result onto a camera, and
drives the UI through per-view bridge components for text, visibility, data
binding, dependency properties, list contents, commands, focus, transforms, and
more, with read-backs delivered as messages. `NoesisUi` resolves the single view
in a one-UI app, and a `NoesisView` auto-attaches the bridges so a value set before
the scene exists lands once it builds. The version starts at 0.10.0 to move in step
with `noesis_runtime`.
